# DD1337 Week 7 | MIPS Assembly

## Getting started with MIPS

Since we don't have access to the latest MIPS architecture, we will be using a popular emulator _MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator_, or rather MARS.

### Install MARS

1) Install Java, if you havn't done it already. 
2) [Download MARS (official version)](https://dpetersanderson.github.io/Mars4_5.jar) as a `.jar` file. 
   * Or, use the provided unofficial theme engine. This is a fork of MARS that has the added setting of themes. Official MARS only has one light theme. See `./MARS-Theme-Engine/Mars4_5_1_1Unofficial.jar`.
   * Or, Linux machines (WSL also) can use `gcc-mips-linux-gnu` with command:
        ```bash
        mips-linux-gnu-gcc -mabi=32 -march=mips32 -o <out-file> <in-file>
        ```
    * Or, Windows machines can download via [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). In a MSYS2 MSYS terminal:
        ```bash
        pacman -Su
        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc
        mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc -mabi=32 -march=mips32 -o <out-file> <in-file>
        ```
3) Open MARS by running the `.jar` file, i.e. double click it.

### Prepare for your assigment

_Disclaimer_: Last week should have been `task-6`, lets do a switcheroo.

1) Create a repository named `task-6-<KTH_ID>`.
2) Clone your regular assignment repository.
```sh
git clone git@gits-15.sys.kth.se:inda-25/<KTH_ID>-task-6.git
```
3) Add the upstream for `task-6-<KTH_ID>` to your local repository.
```sh
git remote add plus git@github.com:IndaPlus25/task-6-<KTH_ID>.git
```
4) The repository is your workspace. You may organise it however you want. I recommend to seperate the regular assignment from the plus assignment in two seperate directories. 
5) Create one `.asm` file per subassignment. Name then descriptivly.

For help with code setup, see `./examples`.

## Assignments

This week you're going to complete two subassignments. The first assignment is to translate a program written in C to MIPS assembly, and the second one is to write a specified application in MIPS assembly.

See `./examples` for MIPS code examples.

### Higher level => Lower level

Learn what it means to be a compiler by translating C to MIPS assembly instructions. Your task is to write a file `./high-to-low/multiplication.asm`, which contains the same algorithms and logic as in `./high-to-low/multiplication.c`. To clarify: you may only use the `add` instruction, not `mul` (or similar).

### [Inbyggda System-mastern](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/TEBSM/20212/arskurs1), här kommer jag!

Show that no one can write single-chip logic as royally as you do! Write an application, which takes one integer `1 < n <= 1000` as input and prints all prime numbers up to that integer. The prime number search algoritm must be an implementation of [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). 

Place your solution file(s) inside the `./sieve` directory.

For help with code setup, begin by reviewing the contents of `./sieve/template.asm`.

### Questions

#### Constant declarations

With reference to `./sieve/template.asm`,

Know the answer to the following questions:
- Why do array declarations in fast languages, like Rust and C, require the given length to be of constant value?
- A single programming language can define strings in many different ways. For example, Rust has string literals and a String structure. What are the advantages of having both low- and high-level representations of strings? 

#### CPU optimisations

Observe the following pieces of code:
```
main:
    #...

    # exit program
    li $v0, 10                      # set system call code to "terminate program"
    syscall                         # terminate program

    #...
```
```
main:
    #...

    # exit program
    j  exit_program                 # jump to exit_program
    nop

#...

exit_program:
    # EOF
```

Know the answer to the following question:
- Which method of program termination is to prefer and why?
