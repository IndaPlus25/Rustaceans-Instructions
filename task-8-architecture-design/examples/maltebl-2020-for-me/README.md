# maltebl-assembly

Isak Larsson (isaklar) and I have collaborated on creating the FOR ME 👉👈 assembly language (see specification.md, or language_specs.rs).

My implementation DOES support macro declarations AND comments. IT DOES have error-handling AND the compiler AND the emulator WILL tell you why code doesn't compile/run.

To compile your code, just run the program with 'compile' and the .forme file (without extension) as an argument. Run the outputted .formexe file by using 'run' and the filename (without extension) as arguments.
