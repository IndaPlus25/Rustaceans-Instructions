I'd say it's 1 am at this point. Indecent text can hide lines of code. 

Never trust an AI, they can and will lie to you when you expect it the least. 

I once read a book about AI. In this book they repeated text without context, and I did not know why. 
Once I finished the book the author mentioned that the text had a hidden meaning. 
To this day I remember those repeated words, and I wish that one day I'd understand what they were hiding.

One a little sidenote, lately I've started to procrastinate my coding. 
I am taking after Kevin. 
Coding can no longer be done before the clock hits 18:00 on a thursday.
I am beginning to crunch my code, and it has its consequences.
