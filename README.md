## DD1337 Programmering

See the [KTH course syllabus](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD1337).

_Note_: As decribed in the course syllabus, the primary programming language of this course is Java. However, as a complementary option, you have the choise to instead attempt a series of difficult, but fun, cross-paradigm assignments.

During the weekly exercises, we will learn about both Java, as well as other languages.
