# DD1337 Task 5 | Issue Week

_Author_: Viola SÃ¶derlund, violaso@kth.se

## Issue Week

This week is simple! You are tasked with
1. If you wrote a chess engine, write a set of issues for your engine.
2. Write a set of issues for other chess engines.
3. Complete a set of issues for other chess engines.
4. _(optional)_ Complete issues for your own chess engine.

Discussions are encouraged! Discuss in issues and in pull requests.

### Labels

Attach labels to your issues. Good labels include `discussion`, `nice-to-have`, `good-first-issue` or `beginner-friendly`, `challenge`, `bug`, `feature`, among more.

### Pull Requests

When contributing code to another repository, it's customary to create pull requests, not to commit directly to `master`/`main`.
1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Instead of merging to `master`/`main`, create a pull request.

Pull requests enable discussions and further changes before merge.

### Grading

This is tricky because issues can be of different complexities, whereas some are pure discussion threads.

Engage a fair amount, where one set $|S| \geq 1$. Write at least one pull request.
